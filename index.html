As long as I can remember, I have been playing video games and making, and My master's from Lakehead in Computer Science paved my path to the Game industry. My Experiences at Unity helped me understand the whole picture of making, publishing, and Monetizing games. What I bring to the table is a unique talent for assisting Pulbisher to get their games on the app store and iOS store while working with Demand side partners to integrate into Unity Exchange with OpenRTB successfully.

The system uses any regular camera which in the first phase gets calibrated extracting camera information like focal length distortions in the camera, intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera, etc. In phase 2 we will use that parameter to create a disparity map and using that map we will generate a 3D cloud which will we transfer into a 3D point cloud using a transformation matrix and reprojecting points into 3D and creating a point cloud. Finally, we will use MeshLab to visualize our 3D model. Keywords: 3D reconstruction; 3D model; camera calibration; depth map; point cloud Python programming language.</div>
